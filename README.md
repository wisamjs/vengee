##About
Have you ever been wronged by someone? It sucks. You tend to carry that anger with you for the rest of the day, until you wake up the next day and feel better, having forgotten what happened the night before.

Don't you hate when that happens? We do, which is why we created Vengee, an app that lets you keep track of all those who have wronged you, so that you can exact your sweet sweet revenge.

##Tech
Built with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) & AngularJs.
